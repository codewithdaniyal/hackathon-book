# Defining Physical AI

Physical AI is not just "smart code." It is code that must negotiate with the chaos of the real world—gravity, friction, and inertia.

## The Convergence
Physical AI sits at the intersection of three major fields:
1. **Computer Vision:** Seeing the world.
2. **LLMs/VLA:** Understanding the world.
3. **Control Theory:** Manipulating the world.

## Concept: Abstract vs. Physical
The complexity lies in the physics, not just the logic.

```python title="abstract_vs_physical.py"
# Abstract AI (The Brain)
def ask_llm(prompt):
    return "I picked up the apple."

# Physical AI (The Body)
def pickup_apple(coordinates):
    inverse_kinematics = solve_ik(coordinates)
    
    if check_collision(inverse_kinematics):
        # Apply 2.5 Nm of torque to joints
        apply_torque(joints, force_nm=2.5) 
        verify_grip_pressure(sensor_data)
    else:
        emergency_stop()
