# Agents vs. Robots

In software, `x = x + 1` is always true. In robotics, `move(1_meter)` is rarely exactly 1 meter.

## Deterministic vs. Stochastic
*   **Software Agents:** Live in a deterministic world (Perfect execution).
*   **Robots:** Live in a stochastic world (Noise, slippage, sensor error).

## Simulation: The Noisy Robot
We can simulate this "real world" behavior using Gaussian noise.

```python title="noisy_simulation.py"
import random

def perfect_move(distance):
    return distance

def noisy_move(distance):
    # Adding Gaussian noise to simulate wheel slippage
    # Mean: 0, Standard Deviation: 0.5
    real_distance = distance + random.gauss(0, 0.5)
    return real_distance

# Run the simulation
target = 10
print(f"Commanded: {target}m | Actual: {noisy_move(target):.2f}m")
